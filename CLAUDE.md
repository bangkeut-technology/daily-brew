# CLAUDE.md — DailyBrew

Staff attendance and leave tracking for restaurants.
Symfony backend + React frontend (Symfony Webpack Encore).

---

## What this product does

- Restaurant owners sign up, create a Workspace (their restaurant)
- Owner creates Employees and assigns them a Shift
- Each Workspace has a single QR code displayed at the restaurant
- Employees sign in on their phone and scan the workspace QR → check in/out recorded
- Attendance is recorded and compared against their Shift to detect late arrivals and early departures
- Staff submit Leave Requests via mobile web page; owner approves or rejects from dashboard
- Owner defines Closures (date ranges when restaurant is closed) — no attendance expected during these periods

---

## What this product does NOT do

- No KPI / evaluation / scoring
- No payroll, payslips, or salary management
- No LinkedIn OAuth

Any request to add the above should be deferred to a future milestone.

### Espresso Plan ($14.99/month · $149/year)
- Up to 20 employees (free = 10 max)
- IP restriction for check-in
- Device verification for check-in (same device for in/out, prevent double check-in)
- Geofencing for check-in (lat/lng + radius)
- Per-day shift schedules (ShiftTimeRule per day-of-week)
- Leave request management
- Employee username for BasilBook staff linking
- Manager role (up to 2 per workspace) — can approve/reject leave, view all attendance
- Push notifications (Expo) for leave requests, shift changes, closures
- Email notifications (Mailgun) for all events
- Daily attendance summary notification (push + email)

### Double Espresso Plan ($39.99/month · $399/year)
- Unlimited employees
- Everything in Espresso
- Unlimited managers
- Priority support
- Future: Multiple QR codes per workspace, white-label branding

### Dual Role System
Users can be owners (create workspaces) or employees (linked to an employee record).
- After sign-up, users go through an onboarding wizard to choose their role.
- Owner view: full dashboard, employee management, shift/closure/settings pages
- Employee view: personal dashboard, own attendance, own leave requests
- A user can be both owner and employee in different workspaces.

## Key Business Rules

### Closure logic
Before creating any attendance record, check if the date falls within any Closure for the workspace. If yes, skip entirely.

### Leave request validation
`LeaveRequestService::create()` enforces:
- `startDate <= endDate`
- No overlap with closure periods (uses `ClosurePeriodRepository::findOverlappingClosure()`)
- No duplicate pending/approved leaves for same dates (uses `LeaveRequestRepository::findOverlappingForEmployee()`)
- Accepts optional `startTime`/`endTime` for partial-day leave (`null` = full day)

### Leave request authorization
- CREATE uses `WorkspaceVoter::VIEW` (not EDIT) so employees can submit their own requests. Backend enforces employees can only submit for themselves.
- DELETE `DELETE /workspaces/{publicId}/leave-requests/{publicId}` — employees can cancel own pending requests, owners can cancel any.

### Leave blocks check-in
CheckinService blocks check-in for employees with an approved full-day leave for the current date. Checkin status API returns `onLeave` (boolean) and `leaveIsFullDay` (boolean) fields.

### Late / left early detection
Computed at check-in/out time relative to the Employee's assigned Shift + grace minutes. If no Shift, always false. All time comparisons use the workspace timezone from `WorkspaceSetting.timezone`.

### Timezone handling
- **Server PHP timezone**: must be set to `UTC` (`date.timezone = UTC` in php.ini)
- **Workspace timezone**: stored per-workspace in `WorkspaceSetting.timezone` (IANA format, e.g. `Asia/Phnom_Penh`, `Europe/Paris`)
- **Auto-detection**: on workspace creation, the browser's `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` is sent and validated against `DateTimeZone::listIdentifiers()`
- **Settings page**: timezone selector uses `Intl.supportedValuesOf('timeZone')` to list all IANA timezones dynamically, sorted by UTC offset, with DST-aware offset labels
- **Rule**: always pass an explicit `DateTimeZone` when constructing dates — never rely on PHP's default. Store datetimes in UTC, compare in workspace timezone
- **CheckinService**: reads `WorkspaceSetting.timezone`, converts `now` to workspace TZ for late/early detection, computes `today` in workspace TZ for date-based lookups
- **DashboardService**: same pattern — `today` is computed in workspace TZ so queries return correct results regardless of server timezone
- **Seeder**: shift and attendance times must use the workspace timezone (`new \DateTime('07:00', $tz)`) — never omit the timezone parameter

### QR check-in — workspace-level QR code
- Each workspace has a `qrToken` (20-char random string) generated on creation
- QR encodes `dailybrew:ws:{qrToken}` — NOT a URL, just data for the mobile app
- ONE QR code per workspace — displayed at the restaurant entrance
- Employee opens DailyBrew mobile app → scans QR → app extracts token → calls `POST /api/v1/checkin/{qrToken}`
- Employee must be signed in to check in — system resolves employee from auth session + workspace
- All employees need a linked user account to check in
- Web route `/checkin/{qrToken}` exists as a fallback for testing only

### QR check-in IP restriction
On check-in via QR:
1. If `WorkspaceSetting.ipRestrictionEnabled` is false → allow
2. If enabled and `allowedIps` is empty → allow (misconfiguration fallback)
3. If enabled → check request IP against `allowedIps` → reject with 403 if not matched

Settings page has a "Use my current IP" button that calls `GET /workspaces/{publicId}/settings/my-ip` to fetch the client IP as seen by the server, then appends it to the allowed IPs list.

### QR check-in auth (always required)
1. Employee scans workspace QR → opens check-in page
2. If not signed in → shows "Sign in required" with sign-in button
3. If signed in → backend resolves employee from user + workspace
4. If no employee record found → 403 "You are not registered as an employee in this workspace"
5. If found → shows check-in/out button with "Verified" badge

### Device verification (Espresso)
Prevents fraud by binding check-in/out to a single device per employee per day.
Frontend generates a UUID stored in `localStorage` (`dailybrew_device_id`) and sends it + parsed device name with every check-in/out POST.

On check-in via QR:
1. If `WorkspaceSetting.deviceVerificationEnabled` is false → skip device checks
2. If enabled → check if any *other* employee in the same workspace already checked in today with the same device ID → reject with 403
3. Store `checkInDeviceId` and `checkInDeviceName` on the Attendance record

On check-out via QR:
1. If enabled AND `checkInDeviceId` is set AND incoming `deviceId !== checkInDeviceId` → reject with 403 ("must use same device")
2. Always store `checkOutDeviceId` and `checkOutDeviceName` for audit

### User ↔ Employee linking (ManyToOne)
- A User can be linked to **multiple** Employees across different workspaces (e.g., staff working part-time at two restaurants)
- A User can only be linked to **one** Employee per workspace (composite unique on `linkedUser + workspace`)
- An Employee can exist without a linked User (QR-only staff)
- Linking can be done by:
  - Owner entering the user's public ID on the employee detail page
  - Owner entering the user's public ID during employee creation
  - Employee entering their employee public ID during onboarding
- Unlinking is available from the employee detail page (with confirmation modal)
- Role context returns `linkedWorkspaces[]` — all workspaces where the user is an employee

### Manager role (Espresso)
- Employee can be promoted to manager by the workspace owner from the employee detail page
- Managers must have a linked user account
- Espresso plan: up to 2 managers per workspace; Double Espresso: unlimited
- Manager can: view all attendance, approve/reject leave requests, view all leave requests, cancel leave requests
- Manager cannot: add/edit/delete employees, manage shifts/closures/settings, manage billing, promote other managers
- WorkspaceVoter `MANAGE` attribute grants manager-level access (owner + manager)
- `EDIT` and `DELETE` remain owner-only

### Employee duplication prevention
- Backend checks for existing employee with same firstName + lastName in the workspace before creation
- Returns 409 if duplicate found
- All employee list queries filter out soft-deleted records (`deletedAt IS NULL`)

### Employee username (Espresso)
- Optional unique identifier for cross-product staff linking with BasilBook
- Must match the staff name or ID used in the POS system
- Only available on Espresso plan

### Attendance uniqueness
One Attendance record per Employee per day. Attempting a second check-in on the same day returns the existing record.

### Workspace persistence
- `currentWorkspace` is stored on the User entity (server-side)
- Also cached in `localStorage` for fast access
- On workspace switch, both localStorage and server are updated
- On sign-in to a new device, workspace is restored from server if localStorage is empty

### Notifications (Espresso)
Push (Expo) and email (Mailgun) notifications are sent for the following events:
- **Leave request submitted** → notify workspace owner
- **Leave request approved/rejected** → notify employee (linked user)
- **Shift assigned/changed** → notify employee (linked user)
- **Closure created** → notify all linked employees in workspace
- **Daily attendance summary** → notify workspace owner (via `app:send-daily-summary` cron command)

All notifications include a `data` payload with `type` and `workspacePublicId` for mobile deep linking.

### Device token API (no locale prefix)
- `POST /api/v1/devices` — register push token (`{ token, platform: "ios"|"android"|"web" }`)
- `DELETE /api/v1/devices/{token}` — unregister push token (own tokens only)
- If a token already exists, it's re-assigned to the current user (handles device transfers)

## Authentication

JWT via LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle. Flows: email+password, Google OAuth, Apple OAuth — all return JWT. QR-scanning staff do NOT authenticate (tokenized URL only) unless they have a linked user account.

## QR Check-in Flow

QR encodes `dailybrew:ws:{qrToken}` (data payload, not a URL). Employee opens DailyBrew mobile app → scans QR → app parses token → calls `POST /api/v1/checkin/{qrToken}` with JWT auth. Backend resolves employee from auth user + workspace. Validates IP, device, geofence if enabled → creates/updates Attendance record. Auth always required.

---

## Backend Architecture

Symfony 7 + Doctrine ORM + LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle + KnpPaginatorBundle.

- API prefix: `/api/v1/{_locale}` (en, fr, km) — except Checkin and Device routes which use `/api/v1/` (no locale)
- Controller + Trait pattern, business logic in `src/Service/`
- Notifications: `ExpoPushService` (Expo push API), `EmailService` (Symfony Mailer + Mailgun), orchestrated by `NotificationService`
- Daily summary command: `app:send-daily-summary` (cron, Espresso workspaces only)
- Multi-tenancy: Workspace is root aggregate, WorkspaceVoter handles authorization

---

## Frontend Architecture

React 19 + TypeScript, TanStack Router (file-based) + TanStack Query, shadcn/ui + Radix, Tailwind CSS v4, Zod + React Hook Form, Axios, i18next (en/fr/km), Lucide React icons, Sonner toasts, clsx + tailwind-merge via `cn()` utility (`@/lib/utils`).

Routes: `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/auth/callback`, `/checkin/:qrToken` (public/auth), `/console/*` (auth guard) with dashboard, employees, attendance, leave, shifts, closures, settings, profile.

### Custom UI Components (assets/src/components/shared/)
- **GlassCard** / **GlassCardHeader** — glass-morphism card with optional hover lift
- **CustomSelect** — dropdown with auto-search for 8+ options, check marks, glass design. Uses `position: absolute` (no portal).
- **CustomDatePicker** — calendar grid with month navigation, today highlight. Uses `position: absolute` (no portal). Accepts `isDateDisabled` callback prop to disable specific dates (e.g. closure dates).
- **CustomTimePicker** — hour/minute spinners with 5-min step. Uses `position: absolute` (no portal).
- **LeaveRequestModal** — closure-aware date pickers, partial-day toggle with time pickers, required reason field, type selector (paid/unpaid). Used by both employee dashboard and leave page.
- **Toggle** — pill switch with check/X icon indicator (replaces all checkboxes)
- **ConfirmModal** — Radix dialog with danger/default variants
- **Avatar** — deterministic gradient from name, initials
- **StatusBadge** — colored pill badge (green/amber/red/gray/blue)
- **StatCard** — glass card with colored accent bar
- **EmptyState** — dashed border card with "+" prompt

### Employee dashboard
Route `/console/dashboard` (when `isEmployee && !isOwner`):
- Welcome header with avatar, name, and today's date
- Active closure alert (red) and upcoming closure alert (amber, within 7 days)
- "On approved leave" status displayed when employee has approved leave for today
- My shift today card (shift name + times, or "No shift assigned")
- Check-in/out status with action button (uses geolocation if available)
- Attendance KPI cards (today status, check-in time, check-out time)
- Recent attendance list (last 7 days)
- Upcoming leaves card (pending + approved) with "Submit leave request" button using shared LeaveRequestModal

### Leave requests (employee view)
Route `/console/leave` (when `isEmployee && !isOwner`):
- Filtered to only the current employee's requests
- "Submit leave request" button at top using shared LeaveRequestModal
- Status filter tabs (All, Pending, Approved, Rejected)
- Cancel button with ConfirmModal for pending requests (calls DELETE endpoint)
- No approve/reject buttons (owner-only)

### Attendance (employee view)
Route `/console/attendance` (when `isEmployee && !isOwner`):
- Filtered to own attendance records only
- No employee dropdown selector

### Owner dashboard
Route `/console/dashboard` (when `isOwner`):
- Plan badge next to page title (via PageHeader `badge` prop)
- Action buttons in header row (Add employee, View attendance)
- Pending leave count badge that links to the leave page
- Upcoming leaves section showing both pending and approved with inline approve/reject buttons

### PageHeader component
- Added optional `badge` prop for rendering an inline badge next to the page title

### Settings page
- Espresso-gated toggles (IP restriction, device verification, geofencing) display as OFF when the current plan does not support them, regardless of the persisted server state
- "Use my current IP" button calls `GET /workspaces/{publicId}/settings/my-ip`
- Timezone selector dynamically generated from `Intl.supportedValuesOf('timeZone')` with current UTC offset (DST-aware), fallback to curated list for older browsers

### Check-in mobile page
Route `/checkin/:qrToken`:
- **Unlinked employee**: fully public, no auth required
- **Linked employee**: requires the linked user to be signed in, shows "Sign in required" if not
- Shows employee name, shift, status, and a single Check In / Check Out button
- Handles errors: IP restriction, device mismatch, device already used, geofence, invalid token, auth required

### Typography

- **Headings**: Palatino/Georgia serif, 24px/600
- **Body/UI**: System sans-serif, 13–14px/400–500
- **Timestamps**: SF Mono/monospace, tabular-nums

### Key Patterns

- **Glass cards**: `bg-glass-bg backdrop-blur-md border border-glass-border rounded-2xl` with hover lift
- **Stat cards**: Glass card + colored top accent bar (`h-1 bg-gradient-to-r`) — green/amber/blue/red per type
- **Buttons**: Primary `bg-coffee text-white`, Secondary `bg-glass-bg border border-cream-3`
- **Badges**: `text-[10.5px] px-2 py-0.5 rounded-full` with variant colors (green/amber/red/blue/gray at 10% opacity bg)
- **Toggles**: Pill switch with check/X icon — `bg-coffee` when on, `bg-cream-3` when off (never use native checkboxes)
- **Selects**: CustomSelect component — never use native `<select>` elements
- **Date inputs**: CustomDatePicker — never use native `<input type="date">`
- **Time inputs**: CustomTimePicker — never use native `<input type="time">`
- **Confirmations**: ConfirmModal component — never use native `confirm()`, `alert()`, or `prompt()`
- **Avatars**: Deterministic gradient from name index, initials, never photos. Sizes: 32px (rows), 42px (cards), 64px (QR page)
- **Page transitions**: Fade in + slide up (`translateY(6px)` → 0, 0.25s ease)
- **Empty states**: Dashed border card with `bg-glass-bg backdrop-blur-md` — never `bg-white/30`
- **Body background**: Three-layer radial gradient on `body::before` (amber/coffee/amber-light, higher opacity in dark mode)
- **Form fields**: Must have `id` and `name` attributes; `<label>` must have `htmlFor` pointing to the input `id`
- **Action buttons** (edit, delete): Always visible — never hidden behind hover (`opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`)

### Error States (check-in page)

- IP restricted / device mismatch / device already used: warm amber warning card, no button
- Auth required (linked user): amber card with sign-in button
- Already checked out: completed state with green card, no button
- Invalid token: 404-style red message

### Do / Don't

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Cream backgrounds (#FAF7F2) | Pure white backgrounds |
| Glass cards with `backdrop-blur` | Flat opaque cards |
| `bg-glass-bg` for translucent backgrounds | Hardcoded `bg-white/30` or `bg-white/40` |
| `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classNames | Template literal className concatenation |
| CustomSelect, CustomDatePicker, CustomTimePicker | Native `<select>`, `<input type="date">`, `<input type="time">` |
| Toggle component with check/X indicator | Native checkboxes |
| ConfirmModal for destructive actions | Native `confirm()` dialogs |
| Serif for page titles | Inter or Roboto |
| Deterministic avatar gradients | User photos or generic icons |
| Amber accent for interactive elements | Blue as primary accent |
| `hover:-translate-y-px` lift on cards | Box-shadow only (no lift) |
| Sentence case everywhere | Title Case on labels |
| Tabular nums for timestamps | Default font for numbers |
| Warm status colors (green/amber/red) | Gray-only status indicators |
| Always-visible edit/delete buttons | Hover-only action buttons |
| `id` + `name` on all form inputs | Inputs without id/name attributes |
| `htmlFor` on labels | Labels without for attribute |

## BasilBook Integration

DailyBrew employees can be linked to BasilBook staff records via the `username` field (Espresso plan required). This enables cross-product insights — matching attendance data with POS sales data. The username must match the staff name or ID used in BasilBook/POS system.

---

## Out of scope (do not build unless explicitly asked)

- Payroll / payslip generation
- KPI / evaluation / scoring
- Team members (multi-manager hierarchy beyond owner + manager)
- Employee mobile app (Expo) — check-in is mobile web only
- Export to CSV/Excel
- Demo mode
